- **Archer safe spot helper**
  - Will reminds you if you have to safe spot when you pre enter, there are no check for now if you pre enter or not, its just checks on the SS device
  - There are 2 detection methode for now, maybe the lantern one is a bit sketchy and maybe not the best one
  - Will play a sound with the alert
  - You can config it to only be if you are archer
